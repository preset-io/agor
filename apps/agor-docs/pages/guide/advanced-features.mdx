# Advanced Features

Power-user features to enhance your AI coding workflow. An image is worth a thousand words, so let's show you what's possible.

---

## 🎯 Worktree Highlighting

**Never miss when an agent finishes working.** Worktree cards pulse with a teal glow when sessions are ready for your attention.

**What you'll see:**
- Pulsing teal glow around the entire card
- Teal border on ready sessions within the tree
- Animation automatically clears when you open the session

**Pro tip:** The glow only appears when the session is NOT already open in the conversation drawer.

## 🔔 Task Completion Chimes

**Hear when your agents finish working.** Set up audio notifications for long-running tasks so you can multitask.

**Quick setup:**
1. Open Settings → Audio
2. Enable chimes and choose a sound (7 options)
3. Set volume (0-100%)
4. Set minimum duration (0-60 seconds)

**Available sounds:** Gentle Chime, Notification Bell, 8-Bit Coin, Retro Coin, Power-Up, You Got Mail, Success Tone

**Pro tip:** Set min duration to 30s to only hear chimes for long tasks. Click Preview to test!

## 📊 Context Window Progression

**See exactly how much context you're using.** Color-coded underlays show token consumption as you work through conversations.

**Color guide:**
- 🟢 **Green** (0-50%) - Plenty of room
- 🟠 **Orange** (50-80%) - Getting full
- 🔴 **Red** (80-100%) - Approaching limit

**Pro tip:** Fork your session around 70-80% (orange) to start fresh while keeping context.

## ⚙️ User-Level Configuration

**Personalize Agor without affecting teammates.** Set your own API keys, environment variables, and agent defaults.

### API Keys

![User settings modal](/screenshots/settings_modal.png)

**Supports:** Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini
**Security:** AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest
**Where:** Settings → User Profile or Agentic Tools

**How it works:**
- Enter keys in masked inputs
- Green checkmark shows when key exists (without revealing value)
- Falls back to workspace env vars if not set
- Automatically injected into all your agent sessions

### Environment Variables

![Environment configuration](/screenshots/env_configuration.png)

**Use for:** Database URLs, service credentials, API tokens, custom paths

**Where:** Settings → Environment Variables

### Agentic Tool Defaults

![Session creation with tool config](/screenshots/create_session_modal.png)

- **Permission mode** - bypassPermissions, acceptEdits, plan, ask, auto, on-failure
- **Default model** - Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini Flash, etc.
- **MCP servers** - Which tools to include

**Where:** Create Session modal or Settings → Agentic Tools

## 💡 Power User Workflows

### Long Task Workflow
1. Set chime min duration → 30s
2. Choose distinctive sound (Power-Up recommended)
3. Start task, switch to another window/worktree
4. Hear chime → see pulsing glow → review results

### Context Management Strategy
1. Watch context progression colors in conversations
2. Fork at 70-80% usage (orange)
3. Summarize learnings in forked session
4. Use summary as context for fresh exploration

### Multi-User Team Setup
1. Each user sets their own API keys
2. Configure personal env vars for dev databases
3. Set individual permission modes based on trust level
4. Work on shared boards without config conflicts
