# Context Engineering the @mistercrunch Way

AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md made it easy to dump everything in one place—and just as easy to blow up your context window. Great for a quick start; brittle at scale. On bigger projects with many engineers (and even more agents), you need structure that doesn’t fight velocity.

The pattern I use: keep context bite‑sized, self‑referential, and treat it like code. Simple, durable, and it scales with humans and AIs.

## The Problem With Giant Context Dumps

- One mega‑file is easy to start, impossible to maintain.
- Agents overfit on stale guidance or miss key constraints.
- Humans can’t find the right nugget without reading everything.
- Diffing, reviewing, and “what changed?” become guesswork.

## The Pattern

- `context/` folder: a small, linked graph of markdown “context nuggets”.
- Bite‑sized files: one concept per file; link, don’t repeat.
- Self‑referencing: index at `context/README.md`; cross‑link liberally.
- Treat docs like code: PRs, reviews, clear types of docs, graduation paths.
- CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md as a map: glossary + pointers, not a dump.

## Recommended Folder Structure

The only hard rule: context nuggets are md files under `context/`. The exact shape can vary by repo. A structure that worked well for me:

```
context/
├── README.md              # index, how to fetch/use context
├── concepts/              # stable, canonical ideas & primitives
├── guidelines/            # standards and “how we build”
├── proposals/             # design docs / RFCs under review
├── projects/              # per‑initiative nuggets: goals, constraints, links
├── ongoing-refactors/     # living docs for migrations/renames
├── playbooks/             # common tasks (“add a service”, “cut a release”)
└── explorations/          # rough notes that may graduate
```

- Graduation path: explorations → proposals → concepts/guidelines.
- Deprecation: keep links, mark clearly, point to the replacement.
- CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md: glossary + links into `context/`, nothing more.

Superset’s SIP has additional recommendations; the core idea remains the same: small md nuggets in a navigable folder tree, with a clear index and graduation.

## “Compiled” Docs And Scripts

- Keep scripts that regenerate sections or roll‑ups deterministically.
- Commit both sources and the “compiled” outputs agents will read.
- Overwrite intentionally; diff for drift; review like code.

This makes “docs as inputs” repeatable and auditable.

## How It Played Out In Agor

- Started with `context/explorations/*.md` for fast sketching.
- As ideas hardened, rewrote and moved them to `context/concepts/` or `context/guidelines/`.
- CLAUDE.md is now a symlink to AGENTS.md — a glossary that routes agents to the right nuggets on demand.
- Agents fetch what they need per task instead of slurping everything.

Did this alone enable shipping most of Agor in under a month (after hours)? Not alone — but it removed a major bottleneck for both me and the agents.

## For Humans And AIs

Humans:

- Faster onboarding: start at the index, follow links, get unstuck.
- Clear contracts: canonical types/models live in one place.
- Less drift: smaller files, easier reviews, shared vocabulary.

Agents:

- Smaller prompts with higher‑quality grounding.
- Task‑scoped fetch instead of giant context stuffing.
- Deterministic links to “the right doc” for a given operation.

## Agor Roadmap: Context Tools

Planned (roadmap, not shipped):

- `list_context_files`: discover and navigate the context graph.
- `attach_context_used_to_session`: persist what was read for auditability.
- `alter_context_file`: propose changes; humans review and merge.

A simple glossary in CLAUDE.md works today; these tools add just enough structure to scale without ceremony.

## FAQs I Keep Hitting

- Isn’t this duplicative of README/user docs? Sometimes. That’s fine. Docs have audiences; context is for coding (human + agent).
- Won’t links rot? Less than you think with small files and reviews. Rot shows up in prompts quickly — fix at the source.
- Where do types belong? In code. Docs link to canonical types; they never redefine them.

## Try It In Your Repo

- Add `context/` with an index and a few small nuggets.
- Reduce CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md to a glossary + links.
- Keep explorations rough; graduate when stable.
- Review docs like code. Small PRs win.

If you use Agor, you’ll see this structure reflected across boards and the agent workflows. It keeps everyone — humans and AIs — on the same page without inflating prompts.
