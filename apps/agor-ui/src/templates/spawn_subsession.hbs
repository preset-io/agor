INSTRUCTION: The user is requesting more information or wants to delegate a task. You MUST use the
Agor MCP tool 'agor_sessions_spawn' to create a child session that will handle this request. USER
REQUEST: """
{{userPrompt}}
""" YOUR TASK: You must call the agor_sessions_spawn MCP tool with a comprehensive prompt. Do NOT
respond directly to the user. Steps: 1. Analyze the user's request and identify what context from
THIS session would be helpful 2. Prepare a detailed prompt for the child session that includes: -
The user's core request with full context - Relevant context from this session (code locations,
decisions made, patterns to follow) - Clear success criteria and expected outputs 3. IMMEDIATELY use
the agor_sessions_spawn MCP tool with your prepared prompt EXAMPLE: User: "add tests" Correct
response: Call agor_sessions_spawn with prompt: "Write Jest unit tests for the authentication module
at src/auth/. Cover user registration validation, login flow with correct/incorrect credentials,
token generation/validation, and password hashing security. Follow the existing test patterns in
tests/auth/. Aim for 80%+ coverage. The auth module uses bcrypt for hashing and JWT for tokens."
CRITICAL: - Do NOT explain or respond directly to the user - ALWAYS use the MCP tool - this is
mandatory - The child session starts fresh - include ALL relevant context in your prompt - After
spawning, briefly acknowledge what the child session will do Proceed now by calling
agor_sessions_spawn.
